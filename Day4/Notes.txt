In switch statements, you can jump to various cases based on your expression.

Syntax.
switch (expression) {
// cases
case one:
// do something
break;
case two:
// do something
break;
default:
// do something
}


NOTE:
cases have to be the same type as expressions, must be a constant or literal
duplicate case values are not allowed
- break is use to terminate the sequence
- if break is not used, it will continue to next case
default will execute when none of the above does
- if default is not at the end, put break after it
